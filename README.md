# CPS_EMBEDDED_LAB
CPS Embedded Systems Laboratory

Hello, and welcome to our CPS study repository.

We are Ha-Eun Seo and Ye-In Choi, undergraduate students at Dongguk University. We have developed a keen interest in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and have started our studies in this field. This repository is created to share what we have learned and researched.

CPS is a critical field that combines physical systems with digital technologies to provide innovative solutions. We are particularly focused on digital twin technology and embedded systems. A digital twin is a digital replica of a physical system, allowing real-time monitoring, optimization, and predictive simulations based on real-time data. This enables us to maximize the efficiency of physical systems, reduce operational costs, and quickly respond to issues.

Embedded systems are computer systems designed to perform specific functions and are a core component of CPS. We aim to develop customized solutions suitable for various applications using the latest embedded technologies.

We primarily use C++ in our research and projects, and we are studying with the textbook "Introduction to Embedded Systems." C++ offers high performance and efficiency, making it ideal for developing embedded systems and real-time applications. This allows us to design and implement complex systems more effectively.

In this repository, you will find our study materials, projects, and research outcomes. We cover various topics related to CPS and wish to share our learning process and growth with you.

Thank you.
Ha-Eun Seo & Ye-In Choi
